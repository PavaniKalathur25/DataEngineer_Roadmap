---

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Delta Lake?

A storage layer built on top of data lakes providing ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel.


---

4Ô∏è‚É£ How is ADF different from Databricks?

ADF	Databricks

Orchestration tool	Compute/Processing engine
Low-code ETL	Code-based transformations
Triggers pipelines	Executes complex data logic



---

5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you mount ADLS in Databricks?

dbutils.fs.mount(
  source="abfss://bronze@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/",
  mount_point="/mnt/bronze",
  extra_configs={"fs.azure.account.key.storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net": "<key>"}
)


---

6Ô∏è‚É£ What are the three layers of a Data Lake architecture?

Bronze: Raw data

Silver: Cleaned/transformed data

Gold: Aggregated/curated data for analytics



---

7Ô∏è‚É£ What is Azure Synapse Analytics used for?

For large-scale data warehousing, analytical queries, and integrating with Power BI.


---

8Ô∏è‚É£ What is PolyBase in Synapse?

A feature that lets Synapse query external data directly from storage (ADLS, Blob) using T-SQL.


---

9Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle real-time data on Azure?

Using Event Hubs or Kafka for ingestion ‚Üí processed by Databricks Structured Streaming ‚Üí stored in Delta Lake.


---

üîü What is a Service Principal?

An identity used by apps or services to access Azure resources securely (similar to a ‚Äúusername-password‚Äù for applications).


---

11Ô∏è‚É£ What is RBAC?

Role-Based Access Control ‚Äî defines permissions at resource or role level (e.g., Reader, Contributor, Owner).


---

12Ô∏è‚É£ How do you monitor data pipelines in Azure?

Azure Monitor

Log Analytics Workspace (KQL)

ADF pipeline run logs



---

13Ô∏è‚É£ How do you optimize Azure costs?

Use Reserved Instances for compute.

Apply Storage Tiers (Hot/Cool/Archive).

Monitor with Azure Cost Management.



---

14Ô∏è‚É£ What is Time Travel in Delta Lake?

Feature allowing rollback or reprocessing of data using historical versions of Delta tables.

df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 5).load(path)


---

15Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Dedicated SQL Pool in Synapse?

A provisioned compute resource designed for high-performance, parallel data warehousing workloads.


---

16Ô∏è‚É£ How to connect Power BI to Azure Synapse?

Use Synapse endpoint ‚Üí Import or DirectQuery mode ‚Üí Create visuals and dashboards.


---

17Ô∏è‚É£ What are Azure Managed Identities?

They allow Azure resources to access other Azure services without managing secrets or credentials manually.


---

18Ô∏è‚É£ What is Event Hub vs Kafka difference?

Feature	Azure Event Hub	Kafka

Managed by	Azure	Self-hosted/Open source
Scaling	Auto-managed	Manual
Integration	Tight with Azure services	Ecosystem-wide



---

19Ô∏è‚É£ What are Delta Lake merge operations?

from delta.tables import DeltaTable

deltaTable.alias("tgt").merge(
    df.alias("src"),
    "tgt.order_id = src.order_id"
).whenMatchedUpdateAll().whenNotMatchedInsertAll().execute()


---

20Ô∏è‚É£ End-to-End Cloud Pipeline Scenario

‚úÖ Store: ADLS Gen2 (Bronze)
‚úÖ Transform: Databricks + Delta (Silver/Gold)
‚úÖ Analyze: Synapse SQL
‚úÖ Visualize: Power BI
‚úÖ Monitor: Azure Monitor + Log Analytics
‚úÖ Secure: RBAC + Managed Identity
