# Day 3 Progress

# SQL Learning – Day 3

## ✅ Topics Covered
- Subqueries (Single row, Multi row, Nested)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK)

## 📝 Practice Done
- Found customers spending above average
- Used CTE for reusability
- Ranked customers by spending
- Compared ROW_NUMBER vs RANK

## 🚀 Reflection
- Subqueries are powerful but can get messy → CTE makes queries more readable.
- Window Functions are game changers for reporting & analytics (ranking, running totals).
- Learned that WHERE cannot directly filter window functions → must wrap in CTE.

## 📌 Next Steps (Day 4)
- Deep dive into **Aggregations with Window Functions**
- Learn **Indexing & Performance Optimization basics**
