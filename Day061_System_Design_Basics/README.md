# 🧠 Day 61 — System Design Basics (Scalability, Latency, Throughput)

Welcome to **Day 61** of the *System Design for Data Engineers* series!

This module introduces three core pillars of large-scale systems:
- **Scalability**
- **Latency**
- **Throughput**

You’ll learn what they are, why they matter, and how they connect to Data Engineering workflows (like Kafka, Spark, Azure Data Factory, etc.).
