💓 Heartbeat Mechanism

A heartbeat is a periodic signal sent by systems to indicate health or availability.

Example:
- Kafka sends heartbeats from brokers to controllers.
- Databases send health checks to load balancers.
- If heartbeat stops → Failover initiated.

🧠 Analogy:
Think of heartbeat as a regular "I'm alive" ping from one server to another.
