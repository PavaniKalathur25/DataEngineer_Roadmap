# 🛡️ High Availability (HA)

High Availability means the system stays accessible **even during failures or maintenance**.

### Core Concepts
- **Redundancy:** Multiple nodes or copies of data.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing requests evenly.
- **Automatic Failover:** Switch to healthy nodes.
- **Monitoring:** Detect failures quickly.

### Example
Azure SQL Database with geo-replication + automatic failover = 99.99% uptime.
