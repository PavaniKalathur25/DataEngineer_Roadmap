# Day 17 – PySpark Partitioning (Repartition vs Coalesce, Bucketing)

## Topics Covered
- repartition()
- coalesce()
- bucketing()

## Key Takeaways
- **Repartition** → Changes partitions with shuffle (balanced but expensive).
- **Coalesce** → Reduces partitions without shuffle (cheap, merges).
- **Bucketing** → Organizes data into fixed buckets, improves join performance.
