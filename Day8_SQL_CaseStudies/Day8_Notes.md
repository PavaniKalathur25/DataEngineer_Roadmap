# Day 8: SQL Case Studies (Sales & E-commerce)

## Why Case Studies?
- Practice SQL in real-world-like datasets.
- Learn how joins, aggregates, and filters solve business problems.

## Key Learnings
- **Total Sales per Customer** → GROUP BY + SUM
- **Best-Selling Product** → JOIN + GROUP BY + ORDER BY
- **Monthly Trend** → Use YEAR(), MONTH() for time-based grouping
- **Category Filters** → WHERE on joined table
- **Top N Analysis** → CTE + ORDER BY + TOP/LIMIT
