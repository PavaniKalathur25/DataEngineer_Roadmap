# ðŸ“Š Azure Monitor & Log Analytics Basics

## What is it?
Azure Monitor = collects metrics + logs.  
Log Analytics = stores and queries those logs using KQL.

## Where itâ€™s Used
- Track ADF, Synapse, and Databricks pipeline performance.  
- Watch resource usage (CPU, memory, network).  
- Detect failures or slowdowns.

## Why Used
- Early issue detection.  
- Trend analysis & cost optimization.  
- Real-time alerts for failures or high usage.

## Coding Needed
Mostly configuration, but youâ€™ll write KQL queries or Python scripts for custom metrics.
