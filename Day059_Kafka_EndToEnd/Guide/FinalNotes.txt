Final notes (practical next steps)

I included both console + parquet sinks; change Parquet to Delta (cluster + Delta libs) for production.

If you want, I can:

provide a docker-compose service for Kafka UI (e.g., Kafdrop) to visualize topics,

convert JSON to Avro + Schema Registry (more realistic),

add a Prometheus exporter or sample Grafana dashboard,

or produce a single-file zip you can download (you asked no zip earlier â€” I kept inline).
