Extra: Scaling & production suggestions (short)

Use partitioned topics: one partition per parallel consumer core desired.

Use exactly-once sinks (Delta / Kafka -> transactional sinks) for correctness.

Use schema registry + Avro/Protobuf for strong schema governance.

Monitor with Prometheus/Grafana or Confluent Control Center.
