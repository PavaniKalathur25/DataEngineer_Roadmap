Why Python & JSON? (short, precise)

Python

Fast to prototype producers and small ETL scripts — most engineers know it.

Good client libraries: kafka-python, confluent-kafka for high throughput.

PySpark lets you use Python API for Spark for Structured Streaming logic.


JSON

Universal, human-readable, flexible schema — ideal for events.

Spark's from_json easily parses JSON into columns.

Language-agnostic — producers/consumers from any language can interoperate.
