# Day 68 – End-to-End Data Design (Ingest → Process → Store → Consume)

## 🔹 What’s it
End-to-End Data Design is the complete life cycle of data — from **collecting it** to **using it for insights**.  
It has four key stages:
1. **Ingest** – Bring data from sources.
2. **Process** – Clean, transform, enrich it.
3. **Store** – Save it efficiently.
4. **Consume** – Use it for reporting, ML, or APIs.

## 🧠 How to Remember It
💡 Trick: **I P S C → Ingest, Process, Store, Consume**  
Think: *“I Pass Cleanly” — data passes cleanly through all stages.*
