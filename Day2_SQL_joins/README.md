# Day 2 Progress

# SQL Learning – Day 2

## ✅ Topics Covered
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN
- SELF JOIN

## 📝 Practice Done
- Merged customer & order tables
- Identified customers with no orders
- Built employee → manager hierarchy

## 🚀 Reflection
- INNER JOIN is default for combining data when both sides must match.  
- LEFT JOIN is powerful for finding "what's missing" (nulls).  
- SELF JOIN helps in hierarchical data like org charts.  

## 📌 Next Steps (Day 3)
- Learn **Subqueries & CTEs**
- Start basic **Window Functions**
