# Azure Networking Basics

**What is it?**  
Networking = Highways that connect storage, compute, and external systems securely.

**Where it's actually used?**
- Moving data from on-premises DB → Azure Storage → Databricks → Synapse.
- Ensuring secure communication (firewalls, VNets, private endpoints).
- Connecting multiple Azure services without exposing to public internet.

**Why used (any coding needed)?**
- For Data Engineers, networking ensures pipelines don’t break due to connectivity/security.
- Mostly configuration, not heavy coding (JSON templates, Terraform, YAML if IaC).

**Keywords:** VNet, Subnet, NSG, Firewall, Private Link, Peering, VPN Gateway, Bandwidth.
