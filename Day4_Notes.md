# Day 4 â€“ SQL Advanced Joins

## Self Join
- Table joins with itself.
- Used for hierarchical data (employee-manager).

## Nested Joins
- Joining 3+ tables together.
- Useful for combining data from multiple sources.

## Semi Join
- Written using EXISTS / IN.
- Returns rows that have a match in another table.
- Acts like a filter (no duplicates from second table).

## Anti Join
- Written using NOT EXISTS / NOT IN.
- Returns rows that do not have a match in another table.
