Batch Processing - Data handled periodically in bulk
Streaming Processing - Data processed continuously in motion
Latency - Delay between data generation and insight
Throughput - Volume of data processed per second
Lambda Architecture - Hybrid model (Batch + Stream)
Kappa Architecture - Stream-only model
ETL - Extract, Transform, Load pipeline for batch data
Event Stream - Sequence of events in real-time
Stateful Processing - Maintaining past state for continuous data
Idempotent - Reprocessing doesn’t cause duplication
